# LUNG-CANCER-PREDICTION
Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting lung cancer based on a set of features extracted from medical data. Lung cancer is a critical health issue worldwide, and early detection plays a crucial role in improving patient outcomes. With the help of this predictive model, medical professionals can identify individuals at a higher risk of developing lung cancer and initiate timely interventions for better treatment and management.
